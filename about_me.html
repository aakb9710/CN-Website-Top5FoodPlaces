            <p>OKAY. DON’T WORRY. I’m not going to start telling my entire life story on here. Nevertheless, 
            I wanted to talk a little bit about myself to just briefly explain how and why I ended up at this 
            point in time, with this Webpage.<br>Firstly, my Name is Ash, I was born in Mumbai and, since I was 7, 
            I grew up in Manchester. Now at the age of 23, there’s one particular thing about me that has always 
            remained the same, that being my passion and admiration for simply good food, like really good food!<br>
            Therefore, by the rule of living life to the fullest (and stuffing your stomach to the fullest), me and 
            my friends would (and still do) traditionally go the extra mile in search for the best food places our 
            city (Manchester) has to offer (as a lot of us do). And so over time, through these journeys, 
            I gained good experience about places that really brings the good food to the table (pun intended).<br> 
            Fast forwarding to the point this website has been made, this website was actually made by me for a 
            single person live project, as part of a course that I had done with Code Nation (of course, if you 
            are assessing my work, then you already know this).<br>So when I was appointed the task of creating 
            a website, I decided to just talk about food, as I am your Fellow Foodie (see what I did there).<br>
            Now you know the origin of the website you see in front of you. Hope you enjoy(ed) your visit, that 
            is all from me, goodbye.</p>
