                <p><b><u>2. Tokies, East Didsbury, Manchester-</u></b><br> Do you love your takeaways?<br>Well then look no further as 
                this Take Away really takes your usual Burgers and Pizzas to the next level.<br>Firstly, their food is 
                extremely delicious and ever so scrumptious, which will leave you drooling.<br>Moreover, the quality and 
                standard (in terms of health and hygiene) of the food is high, where unlike most Take-aways, your stomach 
                will appreciate this one more (subject to how much you eat of course).<br>However, this isn’t the selling 
                point of this Take-away.<br>Tokies are widely recognised for having their very own infamous item on the 
                menu, which is known as the UFO Burger Pizza.<br>Yes it is as insane and wonderful as it sounds. This item 
                is a combination of perfectly done and delicious Pizza, along with the crust having well-cooked juicy 
                Burger Patties at the end of each slice (with cheese on top of the patty).<br> Mind blown? I know right? 
                Eating this food is truly an experience you do not want to miss out on. </p>

                <p><b><u>3. Trap Kitchen MCR, Manchester –</u></b><br>When you talk about Social Media Hype and clout on a food place, 
                Trap Kitchen will find its way into the conversation, as this is one of the most well-known food places 
                in Manchester today.<br>It definitely does live up to the hype as the food is truly out of the world and

                the huge variety they offer), you have multiple options to choose from and the only trouble will be

                want to listen to me, listen to Manchester, as this is one of our most popular places to go eat.</p>

                <p><b><u>4. Sunrise, Salford, Manchester –</u></b><br>Sunrise is a Caribbean Take-away that brings the true cultures 
                    and traditions of home-made style Caribbean food to life.<br>This place is truly a hidden gem where 
                    their dishes are full of natural flavours and nutrition, you usually wouldn’t find in your usual 
                    Take-away.<br>My personal favourite is their house special Jerk Chicken and Rice, a simple dish that 
                    carries the most beautiful scent of spices and flavours.<br>It is packed with a rich taste that will 
                    satisfy your taste buds.<br>Moreover, their food is made in a more natural style ( being cooked from 
                    scratch), along with the large quantity it is served in is just an added bonus.<br> This place is 
                    highly recommended.</p>

                <p><b><u>5. Fat Twins, Oldham, Manchester –</u></b><br>If you love your Burgers, you will appreciate the thought, 
                love and care put into their Burgers.<br>This food place is founded by twin brothers who happen to know 
                their food very well.<br>The reason I can back that statement is simply due to the fact that they actually 
                offer a perfect burger.<br>Their Burgers carry all the flavours you didn’t know you needed, along with a 
                perfectly cooked juicy burger patty that just melts in your mouth.<br>Furthermore, they also sell their 
                very own signature drinks (being strawberry and bubble gum flavour), which are unique and delicious in 
                their own right.<br>They are also an up and coming business in Manchester, where they’re slowly expanding 
                as one of the top Burger joints in the City.<br> They have more chains opening up, however, I would 
                personally advise to visit the original in Oldham.<br>So definitely give this place a chance and you 
                won’t be disappointed.</p>
